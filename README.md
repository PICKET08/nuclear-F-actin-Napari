Nuclear F-actin is an Napari plugin that implements a deep learning–based workflow for the quantitative analysis of nuclear F-actin in cells. The plugin follows a pipeline of cell detection and segmentation of specific intracellular components, designed to enable quantitative analysis of target features. Users can retrain the model using their own datasets.
